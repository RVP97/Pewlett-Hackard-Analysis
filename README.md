# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to help Bobby determine the impact that the "silver tsunami" (the fact that many current employees are about to retire) will cause the company. This will help prepare the company and let managers better plan ahead how they will go thorough this process.

## Results

- From the **300,024** current total employees, **72,458** will son retire.
- The development department is going to have the toughest time since an enormous part of its workforce is going to retire.
  - There are in total **81,293** engineers currently working in the company.
    - From the total number of engineers, these are going to retire soon:
      - 25,916 senior engineers
      - 9,285 engineers
      - 1,090 assistant engineers
    - This means that almost half of all the engineers will leave the company in the next few years.
- As far as the managers go, there will not be a significant change in leadership.
  - Less than **10%**, or 2 out of the 24 managers will be retiring soon.
- Another department with many soon-to-be-retired employees is the staffing one:

  - **24,926** senior staff employees
  - **7,636** staff employees

- For the mentorship eligibility program, there is just a very small percentage of employees from the whole company:
  - **1,549** or, **.516%** of employees are elegible for the program
  - Of those elegible for the program:
    - **34.15%** are senior engineers
    - **36.73%** are senior staff

## Summary

- Pewlett Hackard will need to revamp its hiring strategy for the next few years since a considerable percentage of its employees will soon retire. **72,458** or **24.15%** will retire.
- Considering it is a technology company, the fact that **44.64%** of the current engineers will be gone in the next few years is even more worrisome.
- The next generation of employees could be mentored by the current ones; however, there are not nearly enough employees that qualify for the mentorship program.
  - It is advisable that the parameters for qualifying be broadened or else the company risks not having enough mentors.
- In conclusion, the company needs to seriously take charge of the matter as soon as possible; otherwise, it faces hard times ahead with a much smaller company headcount.
